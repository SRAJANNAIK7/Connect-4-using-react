# Connect-4-using-react
This project is a browser-based implementation of the classic Connect-4 game built using React. Connect-4 is a two-player game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before the opponent does.
